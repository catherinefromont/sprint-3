How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?

I want them to be able to use my site with ease, I would like them to have an enjoyable experience and not be confused on how to use my site.

How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?

By making a clean cut simple but user friendly site will be based on a bootstrap framework and using the Skeleton structure. bootstrap is a simple but tidy and modern framework that makes the website easy to use.
